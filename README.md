**_Description:_** This is a website I made as a requirement to our bootcamp. Basically, the task is to demonstrate the basics of HTML (or what we've learned) using non other than HTMl itself. 

Spoiler alert! Messy code ahead! This is also one of my quick projects so don't expect a very clean code, but its definitely better than my earlier ones. I also implemented a bit of css to make it more lively. I also used a horror theme because it's our first acitivity for November and I didn't felt Holloween last week at all. Lastly, I made it responsive using flexbox and a few media queries.
