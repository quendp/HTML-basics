**_Description:_** This is a website I made as a requirement to our bootcamp. Basically, the task is to demonstrate the basics of HTML (or what we've learned) using non other than HTMl itself. 

This is also one of my quick projects so don't expect a very clean code, but its definitely better than my earlier ones. I also implemented a bit of css and javascript to make it more lively. I also used a horror theme because it's our first November activity and I didn't felt Holloween at all.
